# A-Level-NEA
Ultimate Noughts and Crosses.

Whatever square you select, the other player has to play in the corresponding board unless the corresponding board has already been won or drawn, the next player can then choose whatever available square on whatever available board they want.

For the smart AI feature, I tried using recursion make the smart AI more optimised as looking more moves into the future would ensure that the AI was making the right move. Ran out of time however since I was running into multiple time consuming bugs and I needed to revise for my mock exams and decided to prioritise my revision over the completion of the project. I may come back to the project in the future to implement recursion as intended.
